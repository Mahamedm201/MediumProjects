1) Numerical System Converter
  - This project is about converting between different number systems from base 1-36 inclusive. This could be whole numbers or fractions. 
  - Although it is not super clean and can be made more concise, it was fun creating it.
  
    - First you will enter the source base of the number you want to convert
    - Second you enter the number in the source base
    - Third you enter the target base you want the number to be converted to.
    - Finally, the program will do its magic and display the number converted in the target base.
